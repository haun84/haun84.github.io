# Blog Introduction

::: warning Blog Story
I would like to create a blog to refine myself by organizing work-related topics and personal interests.  
  
In my school days, I became more accustomed to seeing numbers and formulas than writing while working. That's why I haven't written a lot or spoken in front of many people. However, I personally felt that what I saw with my eyes while studying various things was organized systematically through conversations with other people or in writing.  
  
I would like to practice refining my thoughts while organizing the expertise I learn while working. Over the past 10 years, I have already learned a lot from various financial tasks, and I have the knowledge I am learning by studying anew recently. The various writings may not be at a very high level, but there are some people who may be helpful, so I hope you will consider them with the mindset of studying together.  
  
Thank you.
