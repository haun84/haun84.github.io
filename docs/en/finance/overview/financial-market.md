# Financial Markets

## Overview

::: tip Financial Markets
* Financial markets are organized venues where economic players may raise and operate funds through transactions in financial instruments. The financial markets are divided into the direct and the indirect financing markets, depending upon whether or not the transactions are conducted through financial intermediaries.
  
* The indirect financing markets are exchanges where funds are brokered through deposits and loans; the deposits and loans market is a good example. Financial transactions are carried out by banks, non-bank depository institutions, collective investment business entities, trust business entities, etc., that provide funds by lending money or by buying direct securities with funds raised through indirect securities such as certificates of deposit and beneficiary certificates.
  
* Financial transactions into direct financing markets are undertaken as the fund providers purchase direct or primary securities issued by the end consumers of the funds, such as financial debentures or corporate bonds. Accordingly, the direct financing markets, which do not depend on financial intermediaries, play more active roles and are more diversified than the indirect financing markets.
  
* In accordance with the maturities of the financial instruments involved, the direct financing markets are generally divided into the money markets and the capital markets. Additionally, they can be divided into the foreign exchange markets and the financial derivatives markets, in consideration of the features ofthe financial instruments concerned.
