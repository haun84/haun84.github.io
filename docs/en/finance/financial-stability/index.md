# Financial Stability

## Definition

**Financial stability** can be defined as “**a condition in which the financial system is not unstable**". It can also mean a condition in which the three components of the financial system -- financial institutions, financial markets and financial infrastructure -- are stable.  
  
* **Stability of financial institutions** refers to a condition in which individual financial institutions are sound enough to carry out their financial intermediation function adequately, without assistance from external institutions including the government.
* **Stability of financial markets** means a condition in which there is no major disruption of market transactions, with no significant deviation of financial asset prices from economic fundamentals, thereby enabling economic agents to raise and operate funds with confidence.  
* **Stability of financial infrastructure** refers to a condition in which the financial system is well structured to ensure smooth operation of market discipline, and both the financial safety net and the payment and settlement system are running effectively.
  
**Financial stability** can be more broadly defined as “**a condition in which the financial system can facilitate real economic activities smoothly and is capable of unravelling financial imbalances arising from shocks.**”


## Importance

**Financial stability** is an essential requirement not only for price stability, the policy goal of the central bank, but also for healthy development of the economy. This is because financial instability entails heavy costs for an economy, since the volatility of price variables in the financial markets increases and financial institutions or corporations may go bankrupt. In addition, economic development can be limited at such a time, since economic agents find it difficult to make rational decisions and the efficiency of resource allocation is reduced.  
  
Since the 1980s, many countries around the world have achieved the positive effects of rapid financial industry growth owing to the progress of financial liberalization. At the same time, however, they have also experienced periods of dramatic slowdown in economic growth, due to heavy economic expenses arising from financial instability or financial crises.  
  
Against this backdrop, many countries have started to place great emphasis on financial stability when implementing their policies. Attention paid to financial stability is growing, as new factors with the potential to generate financial instability, including the strengthening of financial sector links among countries and the rampant development of complex financial instruments, have recently emerged.  


## Maintaining

When the financial system becomes unstable, such as with financial market turbulence and deterioration in the soundness of financial institutions, a massive supply of funds is generally needed to solve the problem.  
  
Historically, the central bank has therefore naturally performed the role of promoting financial stability, since it has the ability to promptly inject a huge amount of liquidity by virtue of its exclusive right to create fiat money.  


## Monetary Policy

The financial system provides much of the information needed by the central bank to implement its monetary policy. It is also a major channel through which the effects of monetary policy are transmitted to the real economy.  
  
Financial system instability causes a decrease in the usefulness of the information variables used for monetary policy, including price variables and transaction movements in the financial markets, and the lending behaviors of financial institutions, and thus reduces policy efficiency.  
  
Consequently, the central bank places high value on financial stability, so that the efficiency of its monetary policy can be enhanced.


## Analyzing

The factors causing shocks and the paths of shock transmission have become diversified and complex, influenced by the great strengthening of linkages between domestic and overseas financial markets, and between financial markets and financial institutions, following the progress of financial liberalization and globalization.  
  
Against this backdrop, it is essential not only to analyze the stability of individual financial institutions and individual financial markets, but also to assess stability in terms of the overall financial system, by considering the domestic and overseas macroeconomic environments.  
  
The central bank is well-suited to meet this need, since it has a comparative advantage in the analysis of financial system stability. Macro-analysis of the entire financial system, in particular, is considered a crucial foundation for ensuring financial stability.


## Ensure

Financial stability can be maintained when trouble-free payment and settlement among individual economic agents is secured.  
  
This is because failure by a particular economic agent to make timely payment or settlement may cause delay or paralysis across the entire payment and settlement system, and thereby disrupt the financial system as a whole.  
  
Given this, the central bank seeks to ensure financial stability by effectively operating and monitoring the payment and settlement systems.
