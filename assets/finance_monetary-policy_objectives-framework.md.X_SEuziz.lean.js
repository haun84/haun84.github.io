Accordingly, the Bank of Korea takes price stability as the most important objective of its monetary policy.

The inflation target for 2019 onwards has been set at <code>2 percent</code>, as measured by the year-on-year <code>change in the Consumer Price Index</code> (CPI). The Bank will conduct its monetary policy with the aim of keeping CPI inflation at 2 percent over the medium term, while considering symmetrically the risks of inflation remaining persistently above or below the target.</p></li><li><p>The Bank will publish its <code>Monetary Policy Report</code> two times a year to explain how it is implementing monetary policy.
