When you feel tired of going to work or uncertain about how much longer you can keep working, that curiosity grows even more. But when you see figures in the media like &quot;You need 5 million KRW per month&quot; or &quot;You should have at least 1 billion KRW in cash assets,&quot; it can quickly discourage any effort to solve the problem. It feels overwhelming because those numbers aren&#39;t derived from your specific circumstances.</p><h2 id="_1-billion-krw-for-retirement" tabindex="-1">1 Billion KRW for Retirement? <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-billion-krw-for-retirement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1 Billion KRW for Retirement?&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Where does the 1 billion KRW retirement cost calculation come from?</p><ul><li>For those of us who don&#39;t even have 100 million KRW in liquid assets and either haven&#39;t bought a home or still have significant mortgage debt, it&#39;s natural to feel helpless when we hear, &quot;You need 1 billion KRW for retirement.&quot; But do we really all need to have that much in our bank accounts when we retire? Is that even possible? Experts may differ in their opinions, but most agree that focusing solely on the total amount needed only serves to fuel anxiety.</li><li><code>Let&#39;s consider the background of this 1 billion KRW figure often mentioned in retirement discussions. If we aim to cover living expenses and the significant medical costs typical in old age, preparing around 5 million KRW per month means needing 60 million KRW annually. Assuming one retires at 60-65 years old and lives until the average life expectancy of 83 years (as of 2022), you would need over 1 billion KRW for roughly 20 years of retirement.</code> This calculation is overly simplistic and often serves as a way to encourage people to sign up for various financial products. From here on, we&#39;ll focus on calculating how much you actually need and figure out how to bridge the gap between your goal and your current assets.</li></ul></div><h2 id="getting-a-sense-of-the-averages" tabindex="-1">Getting a Sense of the Averages <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-a-sense-of-the-averages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Getting a Sense of the Averages&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Understanding Averages to Get a Better Sense</p><ul><li>Start by calculating your current fixed monthly expenses, such as food, utilities, transportation, and insurance. Next, review your variable expenses. If your current fixed expenses are high due to rent, you may plan to own a home by the time you retire, allowing you to remove rent from your calculations. You might also expect healthcare or dining expenses to decrease in retirement. If predicting retirement expenses still feels challenging even after breaking it down by category, there are some useful studies you can refer to.</li><li><code>According to a report by the National Pension Service in January 2023, the average adequate living cost for a single-person household in retirement is 1,773,000 KRW per month, while for a couple it is 2,770,000 KRW.</code> The term &quot;adequate living cost&quot; refers to the expenses needed to maintain a standard lifestyle, assuming good health without major illnesses. The minimum living cost estimated by the National Pension Service is 1,243,000 KRW for a single-person household and 1,987,000 KRW for a couple. Meanwhile, Statistics Korea&#39;s 2022 Household Financial Welfare Survey found that the average living cost for retired households nationwide (aged 60 and over) is around 1,700,000 KRW per month.</li><li>Another useful rule to consider is that <code>retirement expenses are often estimated at around 70-75% of current living expenses</code>. Generally, spending decreases by about 5% after retirement, as well as an 8% decrease because you no longer need to save. Taxes also decrease, amounting to an average reduction of around 12%. Therefore, it’s expected that expenses will decrease by roughly 25-30% compared to current levels.</li><li>Even after all these calculations, predicting an exact number is still challenging. Life always throws unexpected variables our way, meaning you may end up spending more or less than you plan. The key here is to approximate the amount you need and structure a plan in your mind for generating sufficient cash flow to meet that need. If you’re unsure about your monthly expenses, a good starting point is to use the average figures of 1,773,000 KRW or 2,770,000 KRW per month, depending on whether you’re planning for a single-person or two-person household.</li></ul></div>',10)),a(n),e[1]||(e[1]=t('<h2 id="building-the-basics-for-a-secure-retirement" tabindex="-1">Building the Basics for a Secure Retirement <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-the-basics-for-a-secure-retirement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building the Basics for a Secure Retirement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After understanding the <a href="/ko/feed/preparing-retirement/life-after-retirement">three-tier pension structure discussed in Episode 1</a>, you can establish a solid foundation for retirement planning by mapping out your current situation and future needs in four key steps.

In fact, the contribution rate for civil servant pensions is higher. For the National Pension, individuals contribute 9% of their income, or, in the case of employees, the employer and employee each contribute 4.5%, totaling 9%. For civil servant pensions, the individual contributes 9% and the government contributes another 9%, totaling 18% of income—double the rate of the National Pension.</li><li>However, when you add retirement pensions to the mix, the comparison changes. <code>Most employees contribute about 8.3% to retirement pensions, so when combined with the National Pension, the total contribution rate reaches 17.3%, which is just 0.7% lower than the civil servant pension.</code> In essence, a similar proportion of income is contributed to pensions.</li><li><code>So why are employees more anxious about retirement than civil servants? It’s because many of us end up cashing out retirement pensions when changing jobs or using mid-term settlements for things like rental deposits or buying a home, leaving little money for retirement.</code> Civil servants cannot withdraw their pension until they retire, ensuring they receive a substantial amount later. Initially, the conditions are quite similar.</li><li>What about the National Pension, which also cannot be cashed out early like the civil servant pension? The National Pension aims for an income replacement rate of 40%. In other words, someone earning 1 million KRW per month will receive at least 400,000 KRW in pension at retirement.✱ However, <code>this assumes that contributions are made consistently for 40 years to achieve that income replacement rate.</code> In other advanced countries, the average working period is 40-45 years, whereas in South Korea, it is around 30-35 years—short of the 40-year mark required by the National Pension. With people starting their careers later and retiring earlier, relying solely on the National Pension makes retirement planning even more challenging. <ul><li>The income replacement rate refers to the ratio of pension benefits to the average lifetime income. If the income replacement rate is 60%, it means the pension payout is equivalent to 60% of the average income during the pension contribution period. The OECD recommends an adequate income replacement rate of 65-75% for a stable retirement, and South Korea is also discussing ways to raise the National Pension&#39;s income replacement rate.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="sending-your-current-earnings-to-your-future-self" tabindex="-1">Sending Your Current Earnings to Your Future Self <a class="header-anchor" href="#sending-your-current-earnings-to-your-future-self" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sending Your Current Earnings to Your Future Self&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Sending Your Current Earnings to Your Future Self</p><ul><li><code>Ultimately, to secure a safe retirement with the National Pension and retirement pensions, you need to work for at least 40 years. This means if you start working at age 25, you’ll retire at 65; if you start at 30, you’ll need to work until 70.</code> In fact, in South Korea, the employment rate for those in their 60s surpassed 58% in 2023, reaching a record high. Six out of ten people in their 60s are still working. This is partly because public pensions have not yet provided sufficient income replacement rates for those currently over 60, but it also indicates that few people—whether by choice or necessity—stop working entirely in their 60s. Retiring at 60 and living another 30 to 40 years stably is no easy feat.</li><li>In Norway, a country often cited as a welfare state, most citizens contribute to the National Pension for 40 years. The contribution rate, although varying at times, is much higher than South Korea’s 9%, reaching up to 20%. As a result, retirement life in Norway is more financially comfortable. <code>This is possible because a significant portion of their current income is being sent in advance to their future selves.</code> In the next part of this series, we will explore specific ways to manage and grow the money you send to your future self to ensure a more stable retirement.</li></ul></div>',15))])}const y=i(l,[["render",u]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
