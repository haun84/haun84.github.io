This is because financial instability entails heavy costs for an economy, since the volatility of price variables in the financial markets increases and financial institutions or corporations may go bankrupt. In addition, economic development can be limited at such a time, since economic agents find it difficult to make rational decisions and the efficiency of resource allocation is reduced.</p><p>Since the 1980s, many countries around the world have achieved the positive effects of rapid financial industry growth owing to the progress of financial liberalization. At the same time, however, they have also experienced periods of dramatic slowdown in economic growth, due to heavy economic expenses arising from financial instability or financial crises.</p><p>Against this backdrop, many countries have started to place great emphasis on financial stability when implementing their policies. Attention paid to financial stability is growing, as new factors with the potential to generate financial instability, including the strengthening of financial sector links among countries and the rampant development of complex financial instruments, have recently emerged.</p>',10))])}const y=t(l,[["render",r]]);export{b as __pageData,y as default};
