This means that 3 out of 10 people left the company they once dreamed of joining. Additionally, a survey by JobKorea in early 2024 found that 9 out of 10 respondents were considering changing jobs this year. Although fewer actually follow through, it’s clear that job changes and resignations have become more frequent. From a retirement planning perspective, what should be on the “must-do checklist” before resigning?</li><li>When we <code>leave a company, our accumulated retirement funds are transferred to an IRP (Individual Retirement Pension) account</code>. While employed, most people pay little attention to it until they urgently need to open an IRP account, often hastily visiting their regular bank or making decisions based on brief advice from others.</li><li>Of course, there are exceptions. More people are opening IRP accounts during employment to benefit from tax deductions. If you are in the latter group, you have the time to compare different IRPs and choose one that offers more advantages. <code>So how can you effectively manage your retirement funds to maximize benefits and select a product that will also serve you well in retirement?</code></li></ul></div><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-an-irp" tabindex="-1">What Are the Benefits of an IRP? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-an-irp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What Are the Benefits of an IRP?&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Benefits of an IRP</p><ul><li>An <code>Individual Retirement Pension (IRP)</code> is a system that allows employees to deposit their retirement payouts into a personal retirement account when they leave or change jobs, which they can then use as retirement funds. Contributions can be managed in the way the individual prefers during the contribution period, and funds can be received as a pension starting at age 55. Freelancers and self-employed individuals who are not affiliated with an employer can also join and manage an IRP for retirement purposes.</li><li>Employees are legally required to transfer their retirement benefits into an IRP if they retire before age 55. <code>Whether they have a DB or DC pension plan, the funds are moved to an IRP account.</code> The money received can either be kept in the account for retirement or withdrawn with fees deducted. Although <code>you can open an IRP account at any time, regardless of retirement status, you must have income, such as from employment or business, to join.</code> This is the main difference from other retirement savings products, like pension savings funds or pension savings insurance, which can be opened without income.</li><li><code>The two most immediate benefits of enrolling in an IRP are 1) the tax deduction for contributions and 2) deferred taxation on investment returns.</code> Let’s first look at the tax benefits, which most people are interested in. You can contribute up to 18 million KRW annually to an IRP, and receive tax benefits for up to 9 million KRW of those contributions. For employees, if their total annual salary is less than 55 million KRW, they receive a tax deduction of 16.5% (up to 1.485 million KRW). If it’s more than 55 million KRW, the deduction rate is 13.2% (up to 1.188 million KRW).</li><li>Additionally, any income generated from investments within the IRP account is not immediately taxed but is deferred until you start withdrawing funds at age 55. For example, <code>if you directly invest in ETFs or funds and generate income, a 15.4% tax would apply, but for IRP-managed investments, tax payments on income are deferred until retirement.</code> This deferred tax amount can be reinvested to benefit from compound interest. The deferred 15.4% tax is reduced to a lower pension income tax rate (3.3% to 5.5%) if taken as a pension after age 55.</li><li>While it’s beneficial to maximize these advantages, keep in mind that mid-term withdrawals from IRPs are generally not allowed. Mid-term withdrawals are only permitted for reasons such as purchasing a home for the first time, preparing a rental deposit for housing, covering medical expenses for oneself, a spouse, or dependents requiring treatment for more than six months, personal rehabilitation or bankruptcy, or in the case of disaster damage.</li></ul></div><h2 id="where-to-enroll-in-an-irp" tabindex="-1">Where to Enroll in an IRP <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-enroll-in-an-irp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to Enroll in an IRP&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Where You Enroll Affects Your IRP Earnings</p><ul><li><p>You can open an IRP account with <code>banks</code>, <code>insurance companies</code>, or <code>securities firms</code>. You can only open one IRP account per financial institution, and each institution has different fees and available investment products, so you should choose the one that best suits your needs. When deciding where to enroll, consider fees, available investment products, and expected returns.</p></li><li><p>The most significant factor affecting the returns from your IRP account is the fees. What kind of fees, you ask? <code>IRP accounts have both management fees and asset management fees, and both are charged as a percentage of the IRP assets.</code></p><ol><li><code>Management Services</code>: Covers services such as providing investment products, educating account holders, and notifying about investment performance.</li><li><code>Asset Management Services</code>: Covers account management, execution of investment instructions, and pension payments.</li></ol></li><li><p>According to the Financial Supervisory Service, the average IRP fee in 2023 was around 0.33%. This rate has been decreasing due to intense competition in the market, and if you open your IRP online or via a mobile app, some providers may waive all fees. <a href="https://dis.kofia.or.kr/websquare/index.jsp?w2xPath=%2Fwq%2Frtrpsn%2FDISRtrPsnCmsnRate.xml&amp;divisionId=MDIS02009003000000&amp;serviceId=SDIS02009003000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Securities firm fees provided by the Korea Financial Investment Association</a> range from 0% to 0.37%. <a href="https://www.fss.or.kr/fss/lifeplan/fixesCmpr/list.do?menuNo=200967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Financial Supervisory Service&#39;s Integrated Pension Portal</a> shows that banks and insurance companies charge slightly higher fees, ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% as of June 2024.</p></li><li><p><code>Note that contributions to an IRP are divided into retirement payouts received when leaving a job and additional voluntary contributions, and the fee rate differs based on the type of contribution.</code> For example, if you deposit 100 million KRW as a retirement payout and an additional 30 million KRW as voluntary contributions, and the conditions are that the voluntary contributions are fee-free while the retirement payout is subject to a 0.1% fee, then the total fees over 10 years would be 1 million KRW. However, if both types of contributions are subject to fees, the costs would be higher, and considering that IRPs are usually held for more than 10 years until age 55, the fees could reach several million KRW.</p></li></ul></div><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="irp-fee"></p><p>Such fee exemption conditions are dynamic and can change frequently based on promotions or other factors.

Banks usually offer three options: term deposits, funds, and ETFs. Securities firms offer a wider variety, including term deposits, ELBs, funds, domestically listed ETFs, and REITs.</code> Recently, banks and insurance companies have been expanding the range of investment products available.</li><li>Another difference is that, unlike IRPs at securities firms, those at banks and insurance companies do not allow for real-time trading. The time between the purchase request and the execution can vary, and it may take a while before the trade is confirmed. On the other hand, IRPs offered by insurance companies have the advantage of being convertible to a lifelong annuity upon retirement. As more people voluntarily open IRP accounts, the trend has shifted towards aiming for higher returns through aggressive investments rather than locking in retirement funds safely.</li><li>Managing your retirement pension requires continuous learning. Here are a few more tips to help you choose the right IRP account. First, IRP accounts labeled as &quot;Direct&quot; accounts are currently exempt from fees with many providers. However, they are best suited for those comfortable with mobile or web-based investing, as they are offered fee-free under non-face-to-face conditions.</li><li>If you are set on aggressive investing, securities firms that offer many eligible TDFs and ETFs might be the best choice, such as Samsung Securities or Mirae Asset Securities. On the other hand, if you are less familiar with investing and prefer capital protection products with a small mix of eligible TDFs, consider large banks like Woori Bank or KB Bank, which offered returns in the mid-3% range for capital-protected products over the past year.
