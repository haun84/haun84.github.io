As a result, I haven’t had many opportunities to write or speak in front of large groups of people. However, through personal study, I have realized that the content I absorb is better organized when I discuss it with others or put it into writing.</p><p>I plan to practice refining my thoughts by organizing the specialized knowledge I’ve gained while working. Over the course of more than 10 years, I have worked in various areas of finance, so there are things I am already well-versed in, as well as new knowledge I am currently learning. While my writing may not be at an advanced level, I believe it could still be helpful to some, and I hope you approach it with the same mindset of learning together.</p><p>Thank you.</p></div><p><code>VitePress</code> is a <code>Static Site Generator (SSG)</code> designed for building fast, content-centric websites.
