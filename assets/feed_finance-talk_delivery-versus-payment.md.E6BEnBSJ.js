This system is designed to enhance settlement security and minimize counterparty risk. DVP has become an essential concept and procedure in modern financial transactions, playing a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of asset transfers.</li><li>In transactions involving securities such as stocks or bonds, one party delivers the securities while the other provides payment. There is a risk that one party may fail to fulfill their obligation, which could lead to potential losses. The DVP mechanism mitigates this risk by ensuring that the transfer of securities and the payment of funds happen at the same time, minimizing the likelihood of loss for either party.</li><li>DVP is widely adopted internationally as a settlement principle, with Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) or clearing institutions acting as intermediaries to ensure secure settlements.
