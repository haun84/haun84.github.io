Achieving a return of over 22% in a year is astounding, especially considering the initial purpose of the default option was to &quot;improve the low returns of retirement pensions.&quot;</li><li>The default option is the first step after opening a DC-type retirement pension or IRP account. Since July 2023, if you have had either of these accounts, you likely heard about or chose a default option. If you are a newcomer to the workforce, you may have been informed about enrolling in a default option during the process.</li><li>Despite this, many people think: <code>What exactly is a default option? I don&#39;t even fully understand retirement pensions yet, so why do I need to choose a default option?</code> As a result, they often choose a low-risk, principal-protected product without much thought, just because it seems safer. However, depending on how you choose your default option, there can be a huge difference in returns—some products with guaranteed principal might only yield 3-4% through deposits, while others can exceed 22%. This doesn’t mean you should always go for high risk. Instead, it’s time to be well-informed and make careful choices.

The money in retirement pensions should be actively invested so it can be used as a retirement income, but many participants don’t regularly direct how to manage their funds. <code>This can ultimately lead to financial loss for the account holder, so if a participant fails to provide specific instructions within a set period after the maturity of the invested product, the funds are automatically managed according to a pre-designated method.</code></li><li>In countries with extensive retirement management experience like the U.S., U.K., and Australia, there is widespread recognition that it is the government’s responsibility to help citizens make appropriate decisions at the right time, thereby strengthening their retirement income security. As a result, these countries adopted and have been operating default options for years, achieving stable average annual returns of 6% to 8%.</li><li>In South Korea, the default option was introduced in July 2022 and, following a one-year preparatory period, was officially implemented on July 12, 2023. The primary purpose was to enhance the performance of retirement pension funds, which were achieving very low returns. Between 2021 and 2022, the five-year average return for retirement pensions was only 2.4%, dropping to 1% in the most recent year. Many funds were either not actively invested or were held in principal-protected products, or even left as cash. An annual return of 1-2% doesn&#39;t even keep up with inflation, which means that leaving the money idle effectively results in a negative return. <code>What happens if you leave your retirement pension idle for decades? Unfortunately, what awaits is a meager pension balance.</code> This is why the government stepped in to ensure that these dormant funds are invested actively.</li></ul></div><h2 id="_2-who-needs-to-set-a-default-option" tabindex="-1">2.

If you still <code>do not provide instructions, after a total of six weeks of inaction, the default option will be applied</code>. <code>If a default option is not set and the participant does not provide investment instructions upon maturity, the funds remain in cash, earning low interest.</code></li></ul></div><h2 id="_4-default-option-products" tabindex="-1">4. Default Option Products <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-default-option-products" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. Default Option Products&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">What Products Are Available in Default Options?</p><ul><li>When selecting a default option, you are typically presented with four choices: <code>Ultra-Low Risk</code>, <code>Low Risk</code>, <code>Moderate Risk</code>, and <code>High Risk</code>. Ultra-Low Risk products are, as the name suggests, extremely low-risk and consist of principal-protected products with no risk of losing the principal. These primarily include bank deposits and GICs (Guaranteed Interest Contracts) offered by insurance companies. Recently, due to rising interest rates over the last 1-2 years, the returns on ultra-low-risk default options have risen above 3%, drawing attention. <ul><li>These GICs are insurance contracts offered by insurers, similar to term deposits at banks, that guarantee both principal and interest (special account, eligible for depositor protection).</li></ul></li><li>Starting with <code>Low Risk</code> options, the product lineup expands to include everything from principal-protected products, like term deposits, to investment products such as TDFs (Target Date Funds) and BF funds. As befits a low-risk profile, principal-protected investments are allocated a higher share, while the share allocated to investment products is lower. As you move towards <code>Moderate Risk</code>, the allocation to investment products increases.</li><li>You may wonder what TDFs and BF funds, which are frequently included in default options, are. TDF stands for Target Date Fund, an investment product managed with a retirement timeline in mind. <code>TDFs adjust the allocation of assets so that when retirement is far off, a higher proportion is allocated to stocks, and as retirement approaches, the allocation shifts towards safer assets like bonds.</code> This means that the fund automatically adjusts the composition of assets within it to match the retirement timeline.</li><li><code>If you are interested in selecting a TDF in your default option, make sure to check the target date.</code> The four-digit number in the TDF’s name represents the target retirement year. Products labeled with years like 2030 or 2040 are intended for investors who plan to retire around those times. The four-digit year is known as the vintage.</li><li>Default options also include BF funds (Balanced Funds). These funds invest in a diverse range of assets with varying risk levels and periodically adjust asset allocation in response to changes in financial markets and value fluctuations. <code>While both TDFs and BF funds are asset allocation funds that invest in a variety of assets such as stocks and bonds, BF funds maintain a fixed asset allocation.</code> The major difference compared to TDFs is that BF funds do not adjust the proportion of stocks and bonds over time. As such, you need to check the proportion allocated to risky assets like stocks at the time of selection. <code>If you wish to adjust the risk exposure, you will need to intervene by changing products manually.</code></li></ul></div>',8)),i(o),e[2]||(e[2]=t('<h2 id="_5-where-should-i-invest" tabindex="-1">5.

How should you choose among them? This, too, should be based on <code>your risk tolerance and the time remaining until retirement</code>. To decide which of the four categories best suits you, follow the questions below.</li><li>The <code>first criterion is the return rate you wish to achieve</code>. If you are satisfied with returns similar to a term deposit and want no principal loss, choose an ultra-low risk product.</li><li>If you want a higher return than a term deposit, move on to the next question. If you want to minimize principal loss, select a low-risk option. If you aim for higher returns than a term deposit and are fully aware of the associated risks, you can proceed to the next step.</li><li>The final question depends on the level of risk you are willing to take. If you want to avoid high risk, choose moderate risk. If you are willing to take on risk for the potential of higher returns, choose high risk.</li></ul></div><p>However, according to data released by the Financial Supervisory Service in February 2024, 84% of the total default option contributions are concentrated in the banking sector. Looking at the top 10 institutions by total contributions, banks occupy all of the top five spots. Except for the Korea Workers&#39; Compensation &amp; Welfare Service and Mirae Asset Securities, the remaining eight are all banks.</p><p>Additionally, data released by the Financial Supervisory Service in May shows how heavily contributions are concentrated in principal-protected products. Looking at the composition of bank contributions, <code>90.1% are in principal-protected products</code>, while <code>9.9% are in performance-based products</code>. This indicates that 90% of contributions are being managed in principal-protected investments.</p><p>Despite the purpose of the default option being to improve returns, most participants are choosing principal-protected products. Although some default options have achieved annual returns of 22%, more than 80% of the contributions are concentrated in ultra-low-risk products. This shows that there is a gap between participants&#39; understanding and expectations and the original intent of the default option. Clearly, there is still a long way to go in terms of improving retirement pension outcomes.</p><h2 id="_6-check-returns-quarterly" tabindex="-1">6.

It means that you can directly manage your retirement pension account funds using the default option products provided by your retirement pension provider.

If that’s the case, why not revisit your choice using the information summarized here?</li><li>Participants can only select one of the default option products presented by their retirement pension provider (banks, insurance companies, securities firms).
