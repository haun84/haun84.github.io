Some structured bonds may have a repayment amount different from the face value and could be linked to the performance of certain assets.<br> For example, <code>Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)</code> are bonds that pay interest adjusted according to inflation. The principal is adjusted for inflation, and interest is paid on this inflation-adjusted principal, helping to preserve purchasing power.</p></div><h2 id="maturity" tabindex="-1">Maturity <a class="header-anchor" href="#maturity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Maturity&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Maturity</p><p>When an investor buys a plain vanilla bond, they receive periodic interest payments over the <code>remaining maturity period</code> and are repaid the face value at maturity. After maturity, the bond ceases to exist.</p><p>While stocks typically involve trading the same perpetual common shares, <code>bonds issued by the same entity can have varying terms</code> (such as different maturities, collateral, or credit enhancements), so it’s important to check the specific conditions of each bond. <code>Even bonds from the same issuer will have different yields depending on their maturity</code>.</p><p>Additionally, the maturity or remaining term of a bond significantly affects its price volatility in response to changes in market interest rates. This makes it a critical factor in managing portfolio volatility and is closely linked to the concepts of <code>duration</code> and <code>convexity</code>.</p></div><h2 id="coupon-rate" tabindex="-1">Coupon Rate <a class="header-anchor" href="#coupon-rate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Coupon Rate&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Coupon</p><p>A bond is a financial instrument that pays interest according to the terms of the contract over its remaining maturity. Typically, bonds are issued in the form of <code>coupon bonds</code>, which have a set coupon rate and pay interest at predetermined intervals. However, there are different interest payment structures.</p><p>A <code>discount bond</code> (zero-coupon bond) is issued at a price below its face value (e.g., 9,000 KRW for a bond with a face value of 10,000 KRW) and pays no periodic interest. Instead, it repays the face value at maturity, effectively providing the interest. U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) with maturities of less than one year are discount bonds, and in South Korea, electronic short-term bonds are common examples of discount bonds.</p><p><code>Floating-rate bonds</code> are debt securities where the interest rate is reset at regular intervals. The interest rate formula at issuance is usually expressed as &quot;reference rate + spread.&quot; While the reference rate can be negotiated between the issuer and the investor, the <code>CD rate</code> is commonly used in many cases.</p><p>For example, a bond may be issued with the condition &quot;3-month CD rate + 110 basis points,&quot; where 110 basis points (1.10%) is a credit risk spread determined by the market based on the issuer&#39;s risk. As the 3-month CD rate fluctuates, the interest payments reset accordingly every 3 months.</p><p>Additionally, <code>Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)</code> are bonds that pay interest linked to the inflation rate. TIPS adjust the principal based on inflation and pay interest on the adjusted principal, helping to preserve purchasing power.</p></div><h2 id="credit-rating" tabindex="-1">Credit Rating <a class="header-anchor" href="#credit-rating" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Credit Rating&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Credit Quality</p><p>The creditworthiness of bonds varies depending on the issuer. South Korean treasury bonds, issued by the Minister of Strategy and Finance, are considered <code>risk-free</code> in the domestic capital market and are actively traded.<br> On the other hand, companies facing financial difficulties with low credit ratings carry a high <code>default risk</code>, and therefore, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for this risk.</p></div><h2 id="embedded-option" tabindex="-1">Embedded Option <a class="header-anchor" href="#embedded-option" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Embedded Option&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Embedded Option</p><p>A bond that includes an option allowing the issuer or investor to make specific demands, such as early repayment before maturity, is called a <code>bond with an embedded option</code>. The party holding the option can exercise it at any time within the period specified in the contract, and if exercised, the other party must comply.</p><p>When the issuer is granted the right to repay part or all of the bond before maturity, this is known as a <code>call option</code>, and the bond is referred to as a <code>callable bond</code>. Conversely, a <code>put option</code> grants the investor the right to demand early repayment before the bond&#39;s maturity.</p><p>In addition to repayment-related options, there are other types of options embedded in bonds:</p><ul><li>A <code>convertible bond</code> gives the investor the right to convert the bond into shares of the issuing company at a predetermined ratio within a specified period.</li><li>An <code>exchangeable bond</code> also allows conversion into shares, but unlike a convertible bond, the shares are from a company other than the bond issuer.</li></ul><p>Bonds with embedded options are more complex to value due to the inclusion of the option, and their <code>risk-return profile</code> differs from that of standard bonds, leading to different impacts on the portfolio.</p></div>',12)]))}const m=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
