If you are already close to retirement, it’s crucial to manage your hard-earned assets safely. This means increasing the proportion of safe assets over risky assets and continuing to invest within a reasonable, cautious approach. Risky assets that promise high returns when the market is doing well can be tempting, but sudden drops in the stock market, as seen recently in Korea, can put your retirement savings at serious risk.</li><li>Conversely, if you have 20-30 years until retirement, you can take a more aggressive approach using riskier assets. Of course, you need to understand your personal risk tolerance and adjust the proportion of risky assets accordingly, but generally speaking, in your 20s and 30s, it’s acceptable for the proportion of risky assets to be higher compared to mid-life. Even if the market dips temporarily, you have ample time for recovery before retirement.</li><li>The one factor that applies equally to everyone is time. As time passes and we all grow older, we inevitably get closer to retirement. <code>As you approach retirement, your asset allocation should be adjusted accordingly. The allocation of stocks and bonds at age 30 will naturally differ from that at age 50.</code> This means buying and selling stock and bond products appropriately to adjust the ratio over time.</li><li>For those who are highly interested in investing and have the time to actively manage their portfolio, this is achievable. However, for most people, <code>periodically rebalancing and adjusting the ratio of risky to safe assets</code> is not a sustainable approach. That’s where retirement-focused investment products like <code>TDFs (Target Date Funds)</code> come into play.</li></ul></div><h2 id="born-for-retirement-tdf" tabindex="-1">Born for Retirement: TDF <a class="header-anchor" href="#born-for-retirement-tdf" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Born for Retirement: TDF&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Born for Retirement: TDF</p><ul><li>A <code>Target Date Fund (TDF)</code> is an investment product that manages asset allocation according to your target retirement date once you choose it. Typically, TDF products have a number in their name, which represents the retirement year. <code>For example, if you plan to retire around 2040, you should choose a TDF with &quot;2040&quot; in its name.</code> (This number is often referred to as the vintage.) Usually, TDF numbers are set in 5-year increments, such as 2030, 2035, or 2040, so you should choose the number closest to your planned retirement year.</li><li>The problem is that many people invest in TDFs without fully understanding them. For instance, a 30-year-old IRP holder in an interview was found to own both TDF 2035 and TDF 2050. Instead of considering their desired retirement timeline, they simply followed the salesperson&#39;s recommendation to buy multiple TDFs. This is not only inconsistent with the intended purpose of TDFs but also an example of misguided investing where the investor doesn’t understand the product.</li><li>TDFs have gained attention in the Korean market largely because of the introduction of the default option (pre-designated management system). As discussed in <a href="/feed/preparing-retirement/default-option">Part 4: Default Option, A Must for DC-Type Retirement Pensions and IRP Holders</a>, the default option was introduced to improve the long-standing low returns of retirement pensions, and many default options include TDF products. <code>Even when stock allocations in TDFs reach up to 80%, they are classified as safe assets because their allocation adjusts over time, gradually shifting to a higher proportion of safe assets as the retirement date approaches.</code> To effectively prepare for retirement, it&#39;s important to know how to properly utilize TDF products that have these characteristics.</li></ul></div>',9)),s(o),e[1]||(e[1]=t('<h2 id="the-core-of-tdfs-the-glide-path" tabindex="-1">The Core of TDFs: The Glide Path <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-core-of-tdfs-the-glide-path" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Core of TDFs: The Glide Path&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The Core of TDFs is the Glide Path</p><ul><li>The defining feature of a TDF, which automatically adjusts asset allocation over time, is often explained using the term <code>glide path</code>. The term &quot;glide path&quot; is derived from the trajectory of an airplane smoothly descending from the sky to the ground during landing. This gradual descent resembles the investment strategy of TDFs, where young investors with more time until retirement have a higher proportion of stocks, and as they approach retirement, the stock allocation gradually decreases.</li><li><code>Simply put, the glide path in a TDF refers to the way in which the allocation between stocks and bonds is adjusted from the start date to the retirement date.</code> The allocation ratios are pre-determined, and as retirement nears, the TDF automatically decreases the proportion of stocks in the portfolio while increasing the proportion of bonds. The rationale is straightforward: bonds are generally considered less risky compared to stocks.</li><li>The following graph shows the asset allocation of a 2040 TDF managed by BlackRock, a U.S. asset management company. On the horizontal axis, &quot;0&quot; represents the retirement date, while &quot;5&quot; represents five years before retirement, and &quot;10&quot; represents ten years before retirement. In the portfolio’s state in 2023—<code>with approximately eight years left until retirement—the stock allocation is about 55%, and by the retirement date, it reduces to 40%.</code></li></ul><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="glide-path"></p><ul><li>As shown in the graph, the schedule of gradually reducing stock allocation is known as the glide path. The steepness of the glide path varies from one TDF provider to another. While no one glide path can be called the definitive answer, there are several common factors that all glide paths take into consideration.</li><li>First, <code>as retirement approaches, the allocation to bonds increases compared to stocks.</code></li><li>Second, as the retirement date nears, the allocation to domestic stocks becomes higher compared to foreign stocks. <code>In the U.S., it&#39;s a common practice to increase the proportion of domestic stocks closer to retirement to avoid foreign exchange risks.</code> (However, this approach may not necessarily apply to Korean TDFs given the weak performance of the Korean stock market.)</li><li>Third, <code>as retirement approaches</code>, the allocation to high-yield, long-duration bonds decreases, while <code>the allocation to shorter-term, lower-yield bonds increases</code>.</li><li>Fourth, <code>from the retirement date onward</code>, assets such as <code>inflation-linked bonds (e.g., TIPS in the U.S.), commodities, and real estate</code> are often included more heavily.</li><li><code>The glide path, which dictates the allocation ratio between stocks and bonds, is a crucial factor in determining the performance of a TDF.</code> Understanding the glide path is key to understanding TDFs, but unfortunately, this important information is often buried in investment product descriptions filled with complex terminology, making it less accessible to investors.</li></ul></div><h2 id="how-does-asset-allocation-impact-returns" tabindex="-1">How Does Asset Allocation Impact Returns? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-asset-allocation-impact-returns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How Does Asset Allocation Impact Returns?&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">How Does Asset Allocation Impact Returns?</p><ul><li>The returns of TDF products vary annually depending on the proportion allocated to stocks versus bonds. Let’s take a look at the returns from January 1 to July 31, 2024. While evaluating long-term investment products based on short-term returns might go against the core purpose of these products, it is still helpful for investors to understand differences in performance.</li><li>Examining the returns of 2040 vintage TDF products during 2024, the highest-performing product was &quot;Korea Investment TDF ETF Focus,&quot; which posted a return of 13.19% over the 7-month period. The difference between the highest and lowest return among these TDFs was over 8%. <code>For TDFs targeting retirement in 2040, the stock allocation varies from as high as 77% to as low as 57%, leading to substantial differences in returns.</code> Understanding this helps explain why returns vary even among TDFs with the same vintage. When selecting a TDF, if you want to invest more heavily in stocks, you can use the stock allocation percentage as a criterion for selection. (While the specific stocks held in a TDF are also important, the higher-level factor of how much is allocated to which type of asset generally plays a more decisive role in determining performance.)</li></ul></div><h2 id="_6-criteria-for-choosing-a-tdf" tabindex="-1">6 Criteria for Choosing a TDF <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-criteria-for-choosing-a-tdf" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6 Criteria for Choosing a TDF&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">6 Criteria for Choosing a TDF</p><ul><li>If you want to invest your retirement savings aggressively, you should compare the stock-bond allocation of different products and select a TDF with a higher stock allocation. Remember that this allocation ratio directly affects returns and volatility, and the performance rankings mentioned above are limited to the first half of 2024, not reflective of overall long-term performance.</li><li>There are a few more factors to consider when choosing a TDF that best suits you. Here are six criteria to help guide your choice:</li></ul><ol><li><p>Retirement Target Date</p><ul><li>The first criterion is your planned retirement date. If you plan to retire in 2045, select a TDF with the &quot;2045&quot; vintage, which matches your timeline.</li></ul></li><li><p>Stock Allocation Level</p><ul><li>The second is the level of stock allocation. Within a 2045 vintage, you can choose a TDF with a stock allocation ranging from a minimum of 57% to a maximum of 79%, depending on your risk appetite.</li></ul></li><li><p>Exposure to U.S. Stocks</p><ul><li>Third, decide how much you want to invest in U.S. stocks. Korean TDF products often invest heavily in U.S. stocks, but the allocation varies. If you prefer more exposure to the U.S. market, you can opt for a TDF with the highest allocation to U.S. stocks.</li></ul></li><li><p>Passive vs. Active Fund &amp; Fee Considerations</p><ul><li>The fourth criterion is to choose between a passive fund and an active fund based on fees. Passive funds, which track indices, generally have lower fees compared to actively managed funds. Since TDFs made up of passive funds do not require fund managers to pick individual stocks, they can also provide more predictable performance based on market conditions.</li></ul></li><li><p>Risk Level</p><ul><li>Fifth, consider the risk level. The product description will indicate a risk grade assigned by the fund manager, ranging from 1 (very high risk) to 6 (very low risk). You should choose a fund that aligns with your personal risk tolerance.</li></ul></li><li><p>Stock Allocation at Retirement</p><ul><li>Finally, choose the level of stock allocation at the retirement date. Even within the same vintage, some TDFs have a higher stock allocation than others at the target retirement date. If you want to minimize unexpected losses due to sudden market conditions as you near retirement, select a TDF with a lower allocation to stocks.</li></ul></li></ol><ul><li>By asking yourself these questions, you can find the TDF product that best fits your plan. This is a more comprehensive approach than simply selecting a product based on returns alone—it&#39;s about matching your choice with your personal preferences and risk tolerance.</li></ul></div><h2 id="past-returns-a-minimum-clue-for-decision-making" tabindex="-1">Past Returns: A Minimum Clue for Decision-Making <a class="header-anchor" href="#past-returns-a-minimum-clue-for-decision-making" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Past Returns: A Minimum Clue for Decision-Making&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Past Returns Are a Minimum Clue for Decision-Making</p><ul><li>Past performance is an important piece of information when choosing an investment product. Although past returns do not guarantee future performance, they serve as a critical indicator of how well the product has performed so far, which is certainly more reliable than relying solely on advertisements. <code>To effectively compare returns, it&#39;s recommended not only to check the returns of your fund but also to see how other products with the same vintage have performed over the same period.</code> As mentioned earlier, even TDFs with the same 2040 target can show a return difference from as low as 5% to as high as 13%. While it may not be advisable to frequently switch products before they reach maturity, if there is a consistently better-performing product that suits you well, wouldn’t it make sense to switch?</li><li>TDFs are becoming an increasingly significant part of retirement planning in the Korean financial market, and I hope this discussion helps more investors truly understand TDFs. Hopefully, you can choose the TDF that suits you best and move on to the next step. <code>Retirement pension accounts typically have more restrictions compared to other accounts, but they still offer a variety of products such as ETFs and asset allocation funds. Investors can combine long-term and short-term investments using these options, or, for those more experienced with investing, build their own portfolio using ETFs.</code> In the next installment, we will cover investing in ETFs using retirement pensions.</li></ul></div>',8))])}const k=i(c,[["render",d]]);export{v as __pageData,k as default};
