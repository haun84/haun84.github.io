The government guarantees the payment of both principal and interest. Generally, the issuance of government bonds increases as public spending on projects like infrastructure and social welfare rises.<br> In South Korea, government bonds include treasury bonds issued through competitive bidding by Primary Dealers (implemented since July 1997), foreign exchange stabilization bonds, and others like National Housing Bonds (Type 1), National Housing Bonds (Type 2, issued until 1999), and Grain Fund Bonds (which were merged into treasury bonds in January 2000).</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Municipal Bonds</p><p>Municipal bonds are issued by local governments, not the central government, in accordance with the Local Finance Act to secure funds. They typically have lower issuance amounts and credit ratings compared to government bonds, resulting in lower liquidity. Issuance terms vary by local government.<br> Examples of municipal bonds in South Korea include regional development bonds for financing specific projects, as well as urban railway bonds for cities like Seoul, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju.</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Special Bonds</p><p>Special bonds are issued by corporations established under special laws. These bonds share characteristics of both public and private bonds, offering relatively high stability and profitability.<br> In South Korea, examples include bonds from Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), Korea Land and Housing Corporation, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Expressway Corporation, Korea Gas Corporation, non-performing asset resolution fund bonds, and deposit insurance fund bonds.</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Financial Bonds</p><p>Financial bonds, while similar to special bonds in that they are issued by corporations established under special laws, are differentiated because these corporations are financial institutions.<br> Examples of financial bonds in South Korea include monetary stabilization bonds issued by the Bank of Korea, industrial finance bonds (Korea Development Bank), and small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) finance bonds (Industrial Bank of Korea). Except for monetary stabilization bonds, which are issued by the Bank of Korea for monetary control, financial bonds are generally issued to raise long-term loan funds.</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Corporate Bonds</p><p>Corporate bonds are issued by joint-stock companies under commercial law to raise capital. Unlike government bonds, which are guaranteed by the state, the ability of corporations to repay the principal and interest on corporate bonds may vary depending on the issuing company.</p></div><h2 id="guarantee-status" tabindex="-1">Guarantee Status <a class="header-anchor" href="#guarantee-status" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Guarantee Status&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Guaranteed Bonds</p><p>Guaranteed bonds are bonds where a third party with high credibility guarantees the repayment of principal and interest.<br> There are two types of guaranteed bonds: government-guaranteed bonds and general guaranteed bonds. Government-guaranteed bonds are backed by the government, while general guaranteed bonds are typically backed by financial institutions. These include typical guaranteed corporate bonds.</p></div><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Non-Guaranteed Bonds</p><p>Non-guaranteed bonds are issued solely based on the creditworthiness of the issuer, without any repayment guarantee from the government or financial institutions.<br> Non-guaranteed bonds are generally considered less secure than guaranteed bonds in terms of the timely repayment of principal and interest, and thus are typically issued only by entities with excellent credit ratings.</p></div><h2 id="interest-payment-methods" tabindex="-1">Interest Payment Methods <a class="header-anchor" href="#interest-payment-methods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interest Payment Methods&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Coupon Bonds</p><p>Coupon bonds are bonds that pay interest periodically at predetermined intervals. Historically, physical coupons were attached to the bond certificate, and investors would detach the coupon and present it to receive interest on the due date.<br> Government bonds, most corporate bonds, and some financial bonds are issued as coupon bonds, typically paying interest every 3 or 6 months.<br> For example, if the coupon rate is 10% and the bond matures in 3 years, the interest paid every 3 months on a bond with a face value of 10,000 KRW would be 250 KRW (=10,000 × 0.1 / 4). At maturity, the investor would receive both the final interest payment of 250 KRW and the principal of 10,000 KRW, minus applicable taxes.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Discount Bonds</p><p>Discount bonds are issued at a discount, with the total interest for the bond&#39;s term subtracted upfront at issuance or sale. At maturity, only the face value (the initial principal) is repaid. Some financial bonds, like certain monetary stabilization bonds (with maturities ranging from 14 days to 564 days, except for the 2-year coupon bond), fall into this category.<br> For example, if the coupon rate is 10% and the bond matures in 3 years, the total interest would be 3,000 KRW for a bond with a face value of 10,000 KRW. Since the interest is prepaid, the bond would be issued at a price of 7,000 KRW, and at maturity, the investor would receive 10,000 KRW.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Compound Interest Bonds</p><p>Compound interest bonds reinvest the interest over multiple periods until maturity, and both the principal and accumulated interest are paid together at the end. Bonds like National Housing Bonds (Types 1 and 2), regional development bonds, and some financial bonds fall under this category.<br> The period during which interest is reinvested is called the conversion period, and the number of reinvestments per year is referred to as the compounding frequency. Even if two bonds have the same nominal interest rate, a higher compounding frequency results in a larger final payout at maturity.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Simple Interest Bonds</p><p>Simple interest bonds do not reinvest interest over time. Instead, the interest is paid as a lump sum at maturity, along with the principal.<br> For example, for a 3-year simple interest bond with a coupon rate of 5%, the maturity value would be 11,500 KRW [= 10,000 × (1 + 0.05 × 3)]. Since no interest is earned on the interest payments, the maturity value is lower compared to a bond using compound interest under the same terms.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Deferred and Amortized Bonds</p><p>Deferred and amortized bonds allow for deferring principal repayment for a set period, after which the principal is repaid in installments. A well-known example is the Seoul Subway Bond issued before August 1999.<br> For a bond with a coupon rate of 6%, a 5-year deferred period, and a 5-year amortization schedule with equal principal repayments, the first interest and principal installment would be paid in the fifth year, followed by scheduled repayments of principal and interest annually.</p></div><h2 id="fixed-vs-floating-interest-payments" tabindex="-1">Fixed vs. Floating Interest Payments <a class="header-anchor" href="#fixed-vs-floating-interest-payments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fixed vs. Floating Interest Payments&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Fixed-Rate Bonds (Straight Bonds)</p><p>Fixed-rate bonds are bonds that pay interest at the predetermined coupon rate set at the time of issuance, regardless of any changes in market interest rates, until the principal is repaid. These bonds represent the majority of bond issuances.</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Floating-Rate Bonds</p><p>Floating-rate bonds are bonds where the interest rate is periodically adjusted based on a benchmark rate (such as the CD rate) from the issuance date until the principal is repaid.</p></div><h2 id="bond-maturity-periods" tabindex="-1">Bond Maturity Periods <a class="header-anchor" href="#bond-maturity-periods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bond Maturity Periods&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Short-term Bonds</p><p>In South Korea, short-term bonds are typically defined as bonds with a maturity of one year or less.

There are two types: direct solicitation and sales issuance. In direct solicitation, the total amount of the bond issuance is predetermined, and the issuer directly recruits investors, bearing the risks associated with the bond issuance.<br> In sales issuance, there is no predetermined total issuance amount. Instead, the issuer sets a specific period during which investors can apply, and the final issuance amount is based on the total sales during that period.</p></div><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Indirect Issuance</p><p>Indirect issuance involves delegating the bond issuance process to an institution, allowing the issuer to raise funds indirectly. This method allows for quicker and more efficient processing of bond issuance tasks and easier access to a broad investor base.
