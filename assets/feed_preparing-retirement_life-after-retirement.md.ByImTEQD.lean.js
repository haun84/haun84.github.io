A owns a 30-pyeong apartment (approximately 99 square meters) and has 1 billion KRW (about $750,000) in financial assets. B, living in a similar area, owns a smaller 20-pyeong apartment (about 66 square meters) and has 100 million KRW ($75,000) in financial assets, but also receives a monthly pension of 3 million KRW (approximately $2,200).</li><li>If asked, &quot;Which situation would you choose?&quot; many would opt for B’s situation, despite having fewer assets, because of the stable pension income. <code>Although A might generate greater returns from the larger apartment or financial assets, people tend to avoid uncertainty, even if the potential benefits are higher.</code> This is simply human nature.</li><li>As South Korea approaches an era of super-aged society, with projections that 1 in 5 adults will be over 65 by 2025, anxiety about retirement is pervasive. More people are losing their income, yet few are properly prepared. According to Statistics Korea in 2023, 3 out of 10 adults reported not being prepared for retirement. Among the 7 who said they were preparing, 60% stated they relied on the National Pension as their main source.</li><li>The issue is that hardly anyone believes the National Pension alone is sufficient for retirement, and indeed, the data supports this concern. According to the National Pension Service, 64% of retirees who receive the pension get less than 500,000 KRW ($370) per month. <code>As of January 2023, the average monthly pension payment was just 617,603 KRW ($460), which is less than half of the minimum estimated monthly living expenses of 1.24 million KRW ($930).</code> This starkly illustrates that relying solely on the National Pension leaves many far short of the money needed for a comfortable daily life.

With the exception of special occupational pensions for civil servants, teachers, and military personnel, all citizens contribute a portion of their income to the National Pension. As of 2023, self-employed contributors (regional participants) pay 9% of their income, while employees and employers split the contribution at 4.5% each. The biggest reason for the controversy surrounding the National Pension is the issue of potential &quot;depletion.&quot; It is projected that the fund could be exhausted by 2055, when those born in 1990 begin to receive their pensions, prompting discussions about reform.</li><li>This uncertainty is not unique to South Korea. <code>As you know, aging populations are a global challenge, especially for advanced nations, and the depletion of national pension funds is a common concern.</code> In Germany, for example, there are discussions about raising the pension age to 70 in response to the strain caused by rapid aging. Additionally, the success of public pension funds depends heavily on how well the fund managers invest, which can extend the life of the pension system. For this reason, the National Pension Service regularly discloses the status of its fund management. <code>However, because public pensions are subject to changes in pension laws, such as adjustments to the age or amount of payouts, individuals should prepare for their retirement through the second- and third-tier pensions as well.</code></li></ul></div><h2 id="second-tier-retirement-pension" tabindex="-1">Second-Tier Retirement Pension <a class="header-anchor" href="#second-tier-retirement-pension" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Second-Tier Retirement Pension&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">If you have a retirement pension, you are doubly secure in your retirement planning</p><ul><li>Let’s examine the structure, advantages, and disadvantages of the <code>second-tier retirement pension</code>. This system was created to address the shortcomings of the traditional severance pay system and has been in full effect since December 2005.</li><li>Under the old severance pay system, companies managed retirement funds internally. As a result, if a company went bankrupt, employees often couldn’t receive their severance pay, leaving their financial security at risk. To resolve this, the retirement pension system was introduced, requiring companies to deposit funds with external financial institutions, providing greater protection for employees&#39; retirement benefits. The severance pay system hasn’t been entirely abolished, and today, companies can choose between operating under the severance pay or the retirement pension system. According to 2022 data from Statistics Korea, 53.2% of workers are enrolled in the retirement pension system.</li></ul></div><h3 id="defined-benefit-db-defined-contribution-dc-and-individual-retirement-plans-irp" tabindex="-1">Defined Benefit(DB), Defined Contribution(DC), and Individual Retirement Plans(IRP) <a class="header-anchor" href="#defined-benefit-db-defined-contribution-dc-and-individual-retirement-plans-irp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Defined Benefit(DB), Defined Contribution(DC), and Individual Retirement Plans(IRP)&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Defined Benefit (DB), Defined Contribution (DC), and Individual Retirement Pension (IRP)</p><ul><li>Retirement pensions are divided into three types: Defined Benefit (DB), Defined Contribution (DC), and Individual Retirement Pension (IRP).</li><li>First, the <code>Defined Benefit (DB)</code> plan determines the retirement benefit based on the employee&#39;s length of service and average salary at the time of retirement. The company bears the responsibility for managing the retirement fund, entrusting it to an external institution and overseeing its operation. <code>This is very similar to the traditional severance pay system, with the key difference being whether the retirement funds are managed internally by the company or externally by a financial institution.</code></li><li>Second, the <code>Defined Contribution (DC)</code> plan allows the employee to manage their retirement funds directly. The employer&#39;s contribution is predetermined, typically equal to at least 1/12 of the employee&#39;s annual salary, and is deposited into a retirement account. <code>The final amount the employee receives depends on how well they manage the funds contributed by the company.</code></li><li>Third, the <code>Individual Retirement Pension (IRP)</code> is a personal account that allows employees to roll over their retirement funds into their own name when they change jobs or retire, using it as a source of funds for their retirement. In businesses with fewer than 10 employees, due to the small size of the company, an IRP may be chosen instead of DB or DC plans. Freelancers and self-employed individuals can also join an IRP. <code>As of the end of 2022, the most recent data from Statistics Korea shows that 57.3% of workers are enrolled in DB plans, 25.2% in DC plans, and 17.5% in IRPs.</code></li></ul></div><h3 id="choosing-between-defined-benefit-db-and-defined-contribution-dc-plans" tabindex="-1">Choosing Between Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) Plans <a class="header-anchor" href="#choosing-between-defined-benefit-db-and-defined-contribution-dc-plans" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Choosing Between Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) Plans&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">If you had a choice, which would you pick?</p><ul><li><code>If you had to choose between a Defined Benefit (DB) or a Defined Contribution (DC) plan, which would be better?</code> The biggest difference between these two plans is <code>who makes the asset management decisions.</code> In a <code>DB plan, the company manages the assets</code>, while in a <code>DC plan, the individual manages the assets</code>. To put it simply, if you have no investment knowledge and find yourself too lazy to regularly check and manage your investment portfolio, the DB plan is the better choice.</li><li>When employees reach the age of 55 and have contributed for at least 10 years, they can withdraw from any type of retirement pension. However, the ability to make early withdrawals varies between the DB and DC plans. In the DB plan, early withdrawals are not allowed, while the DC plan permits early withdrawals under certain conditions. In a DC plan, early withdrawals are allowed only in specific situations, such as purchasing a home if you do not own one, paying for a rental deposit, covering medical expenses if you or your dependents need long-term care (over six months), in cases of bankruptcy or individual rehabilitation, or due to natural disasters—these are six legally specified reasons for early withdrawal. Beyond the question of early withdrawal, the most important factor in choosing between a DB and DC plan is whether you are willing and able to <code>manage the contributions yourself</code>.</li></ul></div><h3 id="the-quality-of-retirement-depends-on-pension-returns-and-fees" tabindex="-1">The Quality of Retirement Depends on Pension Returns and Fees <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-quality-of-retirement-depends-on-pension-returns-and-fees" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Quality of Retirement Depends on Pension Returns and Fees&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The quality of retirement is determined by the returns and fees of your pension plan</p><ul><li>Defined benefit (DB) pension plans in many countries, including South Korea, have struggled due to low returns. The primary reason DB plans face difficulties is that they have failed to generate returns sufficient to cover the pension payments owed to employees. <code>According to a report by the Financial Services Commission, over the past 10 years, the average return on South Korea’s DB retirement pensions managed by 42 providers did not exceed 2%.</code></li><li>With returns lower than the average wage growth, companies face financial pressure to cover the shortfall in pension payments, which is why many companies prefer the defined contribution (DC) plan, where investment responsibility is transferred to the individual. <code>In the U.S., DB plans have nearly disappeared, and it’s expected that in South Korea, DB plans will also decrease significantly over the next 10–20 years.</code> In fact, since 2017, the number of DB plan participants has remained steady, while the number of DC plan participants continues to rise.</li><li><code>Another important factor to consider is the burden of fees.</code> Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies that manage retirement pension accounts charge fees. These include management fees, asset administration fees, and product transaction fees. The average management fee for South Korean retirement pensions is about 0.3%, which is not particularly high compared to other countries. However, <code>when combined with the 0.6% total average fee and considering that pension returns have been similar to savings accounts with interest rates around 1% over the past decade, there’s not much left over.</code> Although 2023 was an exception due to higher interest rates, the long-term outlook over a 10-year period shows a similar trend. In a DB plan, the company bears the responsibility for the fees. In a DC plan, individuals pay transaction fees for each product. With an Individual Retirement Pension (IRP), all fees are the individual&#39;s responsibility.</li></ul></div>',13)),i(n),e[2]||(e[2]=t('<h2 id="third-tier-personal-pension" tabindex="-1">Third-Tier Personal Pension <a class="header-anchor" href="#third-tier-personal-pension" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Third-Tier Personal Pension&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Still feeling uncertain?

This is because contributions to pension savings offer tax deductions (up to 6 million KRW per year, or 9 million KRW combined with IRP as of 2024). As a result, many employees either open new pension savings accounts or make additional contributions to existing ones in order to reduce their tax burden. <code>The reason the government provides such tax benefits for pension savings is that it falls under the third-tier personal pension, designed to help people prepare for retirement. If you feel that the first-tier National Pension and the second-tier retirement pension are not enough, you can turn to the third-tier personal pension for additional retirement security.</code></li><li>Pension savings accounts allow you to withdraw funds as a pension after the age of 55, provided you’ve contributed for at least five years. You can save up to 18 million KRW annually, and the tax deduction rate varies based on your income level. Pension savings products are divided into pension funds, offered by securities and asset management companies, and pension insurance, offered by insurance companies. <code>If you’re looking for tax benefits, you can opt for pension funds or pension insurance. If you prefer the safety of principal protection, you might choose annuity insurance, which offers tax-free benefits during pension payouts but no immediate tax deductions.</code></li><li>Annuity insurance, in particular, allows you to receive a fixed monthly payment for life after a certain period. While it offers several advantages, such as principal protection and tax-free pension payouts, many of these products have high fees built into their terms.
