A stable exchange rate reduces the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, increases predictability for businesses, and promotes trade and capital movement between countries.</li><li>However, this stability comes with a drawback: a lack of flexibility in the economy.

While this contributed to the activation of international trade and exchange rate stability, economic growth was constrained by the limited supply of gold.</li><li>The Bretton Woods Agreement, signed in 1944, introduced a fixed exchange rate system centered around the U.S. dollar, and this system lasted until it collapsed in 1971 due to the Nixon Shock.</li><li>Subsequently, most countries gradually transitioned from fixed exchange rate systems to floating exchange rate systems.</li></ul></div><h2 id="floating-exchange-rate-system" tabindex="-1">Floating Exchange Rate System <a class="header-anchor" href="#floating-exchange-rate-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Floating Exchange Rate System&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Floating Exchange Rate System Definition</p><ul><li>On the other hand, the floating exchange rate system is a system in which exchange rates are determined by market supply and demand.</li><li>This system provides greater flexibility in the economy, allowing countries to implement independent monetary policies.
