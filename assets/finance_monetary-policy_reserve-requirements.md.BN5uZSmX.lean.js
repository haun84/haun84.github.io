The central bank can adjust liquidity in the markets and promote financial stability by changing financial institutions&#39; funding situation through adjustment of the reserve requirement ratios. For example, since raising the reserve requirement ratios causes banks to deposit more money as their required reserves, their capacity to provide loans and purchase securities is reduced, thus leading to a decline in the volume of money in circulation. Consequently, liquidity is reduced and the possibility of financial unrest arising from an excessive increase in lending can be averted.</p></li><li><p>Reserve requirements are still regarded as an important monetary policy tool in a number of major countries including Korea, although used less frequently than in the past as the monetary base-focused orientation of monetary policy has shifted to an interest rate-focused orientation around the world from the 1980s. This is ascribable to its great usefulness in that it not only ensures seamless payments and settlements among financial institutions across their checking accounts with the central bank by having them hold a certain proportion of their reserves in the accounts, but it also enhances the efficiency of interest rate policy by stabilizing short-term market rates.</p></li><li><p>The financial institutions subject to the current reserve requirement regime include commercial banks and specialized banks. These institutions are required to maintain reserves corresponding to their reserve requirement ratios differentiated within a range between 0~7% depending upon their deposit liability types. Meanwhile, under the revised Bank of Korea Act, from December 17, 2011 reserve requirements can be imposed on some types of bank debentures as well as the existing deposit liabilities. Financial institutions should maintain the required reserve in the Bank of Korea in the form of current deposits, but they may hold up to 35% of their reserves in the form of vault cash consisting of banknotes of the Bank of Korea.</p></li></ul></div><h2 id="reserve-requirement-ratio-by-deposit-type" tabindex="-1">Reserve Requirement Ratio by Deposit Type <a class="header-anchor" href="#reserve-requirement-ratio-by-deposit-type" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reserve Requirement Ratio by Deposit Type&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Reserve Requirement Ratio by Deposit Type (Feb 2024)</li></ul><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Deposit type</th><th style="text-align:center;">Reserve Requirement Ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Long-term savings deposits for housing, Property formation savings</td><td style="text-align:center;">0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Time deposits, installment savings, mutual installments, housing installments, CD</td><td style="text-align:center;">2.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td style="text-align:center;">7.0%</td></tr></tbody></table>',7)]))}const y=t(s,[["render",a]]);export{d as __pageData,y as default};
